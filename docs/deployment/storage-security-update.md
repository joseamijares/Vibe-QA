# Storage Security Update Summary

## Date: 2025-01-31

### Overview
This update implements critical security enhancements and optimizations for the VibeQA widget's screenshot storage system.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Storage RLS Policies ✅
- **File**: `supabase/migrations/20250801_fix_storage_rls_policies.sql`
- Created helper functions to extract organization ID from storage paths
- Updated RLS policies to correctly validate multi-tenant access
- Added proper indexes for performance

### 2. Implemented Signed URLs ✅
- **File**: `supabase/functions/_shared/storage-utils.ts`
- Replaced public URLs with signed URLs (1-hour expiration)
- Added fallback mechanism for compatibility
- Ensures media files are only accessible to authorized users

### 3. Added Path Validation & Security ✅
- **File**: `supabase/functions/_shared/storage-utils.ts`
- UUID validation for organization and feedback IDs
- Filename sanitization to prevent directory traversal
- Protection against path injection attacks

### 4. WebP Image Optimization ✅
- **Files**: 
  - `src/widget/utils/screenshot.ts`
  - `src/widget/utils/mediaManager.ts`
  - `src/widget/VibeQAWidget.ts`
- Default format changed from PNG to WebP
- 85% quality setting for optimal size/quality balance
- Automatic fallback to PNG for unsupported browsers
- Progressive compression for large files

## Security Improvements

1. **Multi-tenant Isolation**: Files are stored in `{organizationId}/{feedbackId}/` structure
2. **Access Control**: Only organization members can view their files
3. **URL Security**: Signed URLs prevent unauthorized access
4. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated

## Performance Benefits

- **WebP Compression**: 25-85% smaller file sizes
- **Optimized Quality**: Maintains visual quality at 85% compression
- **Smart Fallbacks**: Automatic format selection based on browser support

## Deployment Instructions

1. Apply the migration:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/apply-storage-security.sh
   ```

2. Deploy updated Edge Functions:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy submit-feedback
   ```

3. Clear browser cache and test widget

## Verification Steps

1. Upload a screenshot through the widget
2. Check that the file is stored as WebP (when supported)
3. Verify signed URL expiration works
4. Test that other organizations cannot access files

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Revert to previous Edge Function version
2. Update storage utils to use public URLs temporarily
3. Investigate and fix issues before re-deploying

## Future Enhancements

- Server-side image optimization pipeline
- Virus scanning integration
- Advanced compression algorithms
- CDN integration for faster delivery
