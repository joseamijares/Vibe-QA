4. Automated testing in CI
5. Deploy to staging first
6. Production deploy after QA

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests: 80% coverage minimum
- Integration tests for all APIs
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Performance tests before each release
- Security scanning in CI/CD

### Documentation Standards
- API documentation auto-generated
- Component documentation with Storybook
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Deployment runbooks
- Troubleshooting guides

### Performance Benchmarks
| Metric | Target | Critical |
|--------|--------|----------|
| API Response | < 200ms | < 500ms |
| Dashboard Load | < 2s | < 4s |
| Widget Impact | < 50ms | < 100ms |
| Uptime | 99.9% | 99.5% |

### Deployment Checklist
