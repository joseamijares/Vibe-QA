3. Simplified UI components to handle only 2 plans
4. Updated billing page grid to show 2 columns instead of 4

### API Changes
1. Edge functions now default to 'basic' plan
2. Stripe webhook handles cancellations by downgrading to 'basic'
3. Feedback limits enforced based on actual plan limits

### Documentation Updates
1. Updated all documentation to reflect 2-plan system
2. Removed references to Free and Enterprise plans

## Migration Path

For existing deployments:

2. Deploy updated Edge Functions
3. Deploy frontend with updated plan constants

## Usage Limit Enforcement

The system now enforces these limits:

- **Feedback submission**: Returns 429 error when monthly limit exceeded
- **Real-time tracking**: Usage updates immediately via subscriptions
- **UI indicators**: Progress bars and badges show usage status
