I'll create compelling landing page copy for Vibe.qa that captures Harry Dry's style - punchy, conversational, and benefit-focused. Let me craft something that will make developers stop scrolling and say "finally!"

# **QA feedback that doesn't suck**

### Your testers hate filing bugs. You hate missing them. <br/>We fixed both.

## **Bug reporting in 10 seconds, not 10 minutes**

Add `?qa=on` to any URL. Click the floating button. Report the bug. That's it.

No logins. No forms. No friction.

Just feedback that actually gets reported.

## **Everything your devs need to fix it**

✓ **Annotated screenshots** - Draw right on the problem  
✓ **Console logs** - Errors included automatically  
✓ **Browser details** - No more "works on my machine"  
✓ **Screen recordings** - Show, don't tell  

One click captures it all. Your devs will thank you.

**Pro tip**: This copy follows Harry Dry's principles:
- Short, punchy sentences
- Benefits over features
- Social proof early
- Clear value proposition
- Conversational tone
- Specific numbers
- Pattern interrupts
- Minimal jargon
- Strong CTAs

The key is making QA feedback feel less like a chore and more like a modern developer tool. Every line drives home the core benefit: faster, easier bug reporting that teams will actually use.
