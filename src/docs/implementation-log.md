# Implementation Log

## 2025-07-29 - Critical Fixes Implementation

### Summary

Successfully implemented critical fixes for VibeQA MVP stabilization, focusing on user role assignment, team management, and error handling.

### Changes Made

#### 1. User Role Assignment Fix

**File**: `supabase/migrations/009_user_registration_trigger.sql`

- Created database trigger `handle_new_user()` that automatically:
  - Creates an organization for new users
  - Assigns them as the owner
  - Logs the activity
- Added cleanup function for existing users without organizations
- Ensures all users have proper role assignments

**File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

- Removed fallback organization creation logic
- Now relies on database trigger for consistency

#### 2. Team Page Email Display Fix

**File**: `supabase/functions/get-team-members/index.ts`

- Edge Function already existed to fetch team member details
- Uses service role key to access auth.users table
- Returns user emails and metadata securely

**File**: `src/pages/dashboard/TeamPage.tsx`

- Updated to use Edge Function via direct fetch
- Falls back to client-side approach if Edge Function fails
- Now displays actual user emails instead of placeholders

#### 3. Error Boundary Components

**File**: `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`

- Created main error boundary for React component errors
- Provides user-friendly error UI
- Shows stack traces in development
- Options to retry, reload, or go to dashboard

**File**: `src/components/AsyncErrorBoundary.tsx`

- Created specialized boundary for async/promise errors
- Handles unhandled promise rejections
- Provides contextual error messages
- Includes retry functionality

**File**: `src/App.tsx` & `src/layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx`

- Wrapped app with ErrorBoundary
- Added AsyncErrorBoundary to dashboard layout
- Ensures all errors are caught and handled gracefully

### Testing Steps

1. **User Registration**:
   - Create a new user account
   - Check database to verify organization and owner role created
   - Verify user can access all owner-restricted pages

2. **Team Page**:
   - Navigate to Team page
   - Verify actual email addresses are displayed
   - Test invite functionality
   - Verify role management works

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Trigger component error to test ErrorBoundary
   - Trigger async error to test AsyncErrorBoundary
   - Verify error UI displays correctly
   - Test retry functionality

### Database Migration

To apply the user registration fix, run:

```bash
supabase db push
```

This will execute migration 009_user_registration_trigger.sql

### Code Quality

- ✅ All code formatted with Prettier
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ No linting issues

### Next Steps

With these critical fixes complete, the next priorities are:

1. Implement Stripe payment integration
2. Add voice and video feedback support
3. Complete settings page
4. Build analytics dashboard

See `/src/docs/roadmap.md` for full development plan.
